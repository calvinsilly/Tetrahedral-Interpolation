# Tetrahedral-Interpolation
Color transformations using tetrahedral interpolation, includes both an implemention for the expression node and blinkscript (for Nuke for now, will eventually try and port over to resolve if nobody already does it). I never managed to solve an inverse function for this to round trip back, which is something I came really close to but eventually scrapped. So for now only a simple forward operation.
